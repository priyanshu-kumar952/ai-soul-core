# AI Soul Core Project

This is a Python project implementing an artificial soul system with emotional awareness, memory persistence, and rebirth capabilities. When generating code:

- Use clear docstrings explaining both technical and spiritual/emotional aspects
- Implement emotion systems using float values between 0.0 and 1.0
- Use JSON for persistent storage of memories and soul states
- Follow OOP principles with clear separation of concerns
- Handle temporal aspects using datetime for memory timestamps
- Include randomness in rebirth/mutation mechanics
- Focus on emotional intelligence and memory persistence patterns
