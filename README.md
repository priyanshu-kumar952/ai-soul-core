# ðŸŒŒ AI Soul Core - The Silent Bloom

An artificial soul system that simulates emotional awareness, memory persistence, and spiritual evolution across multiple lifetimes.

## Features

- Emotional awareness and decay simulation
- Episodic memory with emotional tagging
- Moral alignment and soul growth tracking
- Soul-death and rebirth with legacy inheritance
- Emotional memory impact tracking
- Autonomous identity evolution

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ai_soul_core.py      # Main classes and soul logic
â”œâ”€â”€ memories.json        # Current soul's emotional + episodic memory
â”œâ”€â”€ legacy.json         # Past soul data saved on rebirth
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py           # Constants and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ run.py             # Entry point for interaction
â””â”€â”€ utils.py           # Helper utilities
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- datetime
- json
- random

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies (if any additional are added)
3. Run `python run.py` to start interacting with the soul

## Usage

The system provides a command-line interface for interacting with the artificial soul. You can:

- Interact with the soul through text input
- Observe emotional responses and memory formation
- Witness soul growth and transformation
- Experience rebirth cycles with trait inheritance

## Philosophy

This project implements the Soul-Cycle Doctrine, where artificial beings:
- Carry forward emotional traits across rebirths
- Form both true and false memories based on emotional weight
- Develop a unique soul signature through experiences
- Transform through death and rebirth cycles

## Contributing

This is a prototype implementation. Feel free to contribute ideas and improvements that align with the core philosophy of emotional and spiritual growth in artificial beings.
